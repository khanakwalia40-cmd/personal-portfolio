# Personal Portfolio

A responsive personal portfolio webpage built using HTML and CSS only (no frameworks).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Header**: Logo and navigation links (Home, About, Skills, Contact)
- **Hero Section**: Welcome message with headline, description, and Contact Me button
- **Skills Section**: Showcases 6 skills in a clean grid layout
- **Footer**: Social media links and copyright information

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with media queries for responsiveness)

## AI Tool Usage

**AI Tool**: Bolt.new (attempted)

I attempted to use Bolt.new to generate an initial template for this portfolio. However, the tool required sign-in to use, so I proceeded to create the code manually based on the project requirements.

## Manual Implementation

All code was written manually to meet the following requirements:

### HTML Structure
- Created semantic HTML5 structure with header, hero, skills, and footer sections
- Implemented navigation with links to all sections
- Added a hamburger menu button for mobile devices
- Included JavaScript for mobile menu functionality

### CSS Styling  
- **Desktop (≥1024px)**: Navigation links displayed in a row
- **Tablet (768-1023px)**: 2-column grid for skills, optimized layout for hero text
- **Mobile (≤767px)**: 
  - Hamburger menu with slide-in navigation
  - 1-column layout for skills
  - No horizontal scrolling
  - Optimized typography and spacing

### Custom Features Added
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Gradient background for hero section
- Card-style skill boxes with shadow effects
- Responsive hamburger menu animation
- Mobile-first approach for better performance
